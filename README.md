# Project-1
Stream one Project one Front End/ Code Institute first milestone Project

<h2> My Project </h2>

I decided to make my Project based around a friends Tree Surgery business, testing myself to be creative in another Website
rather than the Example given. It Features a Home Page, Contact, About and a gallery/portfolio all accessed through a Navigation
bar, this transforms into a dropdown menu on smaller screens.

<h2> Technologies used </h2>

I implemented my understanding of HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and used third party libraries BOOTSTRAP, JQUERY and Google Fonts to 
create this front end design. I viewed and sampled my Work using the Broswers Google Chrome and Safari. I used a Bootstrap
carousel on the Home Page, similar to the one in Stream 1 of the course and implemented a Bootstrap navigation.

<h2> Testing </h2>

I tested the site using Google Chromes Dev Tools, and found it worked well on any Tablet, PC or 90% of phone screens Large and 
Smaller.
